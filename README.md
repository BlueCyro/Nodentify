# This is a [NeosModloader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that allows you to comment on LogiX nodes and open what reference arrows point at.

It's pretty self-explanatory. Just hold click on a node and you'll be able to edit what it says. You can also open the reference arrows and see what they point to. Oh, it's also compatible with NML mod options, so that's neat too.
