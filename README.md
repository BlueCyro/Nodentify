# This is a [NeosModloader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that allows you to comment on LogiX nodes and open what reference arrows point at.

It's pretty self-explanatory. Just hold click on a node and you'll be able to edit what it says. You can also open the reference arrows and see what they point to.
